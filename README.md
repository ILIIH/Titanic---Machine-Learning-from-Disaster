This is the legendary Titanic ML competition 

In this competition, there are two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.

Train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, this database reveal whether passanger survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. The aim is to predict these outcomes.
